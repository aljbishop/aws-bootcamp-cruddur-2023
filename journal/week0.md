# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Homework & Tasks

### AWS CLI

To prove that I installed the AWS CLI I will provide the instructions that I followed on my Windows 11 local PC.

I ran the the following command to install the AWS CLI:

  ```cli
  msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
  ```
 I verified the installation with the following command:
 
   ```cli
   aws --version
   ```

###  Create Budgets and Billing Alarm

**Two Budgets created:**

One **_Zero Spend Budget_** (notifies me once my spending exceeds 0.01 USD which is above the AWS Free Tier limits).

One **_Monthly Cost Budget_** (when the actual cost is greater than 85.00% (8.00 USD) of my budgeted amount (10.00 USD), the alert threshold will be exceeded. Also, there is a second alert for a _forecast_ of reaching 100% of the budget amount, and finally a third alert when exceeded over 100% of the full budget amount).

**Billing Alarm created:**

**_AWS Bootcamp DailyEstimatedCharges_**. Alarm condition - if the threshold value is greater than 1.5 USD for a period of 1 day.

### Create Admin User and User Group

User created named **_Bishop_** and added to the **Admin** User Group which was also created in this account. **'AdministratorAccess'** and **'Billing'** AWS defined policies have been attached to the Admin group and therefore also attached to the user:

**MFA** is also enabled for the user alongside a **Secret Access Key** and **Access Key ID** (exported .csv file locally).
