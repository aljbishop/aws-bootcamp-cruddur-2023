**Two Budgets created:**

One **_Zero Spend Budget_** (notifies me once my spending exceeds 0.01 USD which is above the AWS Free Tier limits).

One **_Monthly Cost Budget_** (when the actual cost is greater than 85.00% (8.00 USD) of my budgeted amount (10.00 USD), the alert threshold will be exceeded. Also, there is a second alert for a _forecast_ of reaching 100% of the budget amount, and finally a third alert when exceeded over 100% of the full budget amount).

**Billing Alarm created:**

**_AWS Bootcamp DailyEstimatedCharges_**. Alarm condition - if the threshold value is greater than 1.5 USD for a period of 1 day.

User created named **_Bishop_** and added to the **Admin** User Group which was also created in this account. **'AdministratorAccess'** and **'Billing'** AWS defined policies have been attached to the Admin group and therefore also attached to the user:
